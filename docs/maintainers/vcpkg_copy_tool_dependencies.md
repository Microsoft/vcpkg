# vcpkg_copy_tool_dependencies

The latest version of this document lives in the [vcpkg repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/docs/maintainers/vcpkg_copy_tool_dependencies.md).

Copy all DLL dependencies of built tools into the tool folder.

## Usage
```cmake
vcpkg_copy_tool_dependencies(
    [TOOL_DIR <${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/tools/${PORT}>]
    [DEPENDENCIES <dep1>...]
)
```
## TOOL_DIR
The path to the directory containing the tools. This will be set to `${CURRENT_PACKAGES_DIR}/tools/${PORT}` if omitted.

## DEPENDENCIES
A list of dynamic libraries a tool is likely to load at runtime, such as plugins,
or other Run-Time Dynamic Linking mechanisms like LoadLibrary or dlopen.
These libraries will be copied into the same directory as the tool
even if they are not statically determined as dependencies from inspection of their import tables.

## Notes
This command should always be called by portfiles after they have finished rearranging the binary output, if they have any tools.

## Examples

* [glib](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/glib/portfile.cmake)
* [fltk](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/fltk/portfile.cmake)
